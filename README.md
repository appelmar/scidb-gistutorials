# scidb-gistutorials
A couple of tutorials that demonstrate using GIS tools for SciDB

## Requirements
To run the tutorials you need a running installation of SciDB including its HTTP web service Shim, the plugin [scidb4geo](https://github.com/mappl/scidb4geo) to enable spatial referencing, and the [GDAL driver for scidb](https://github.com/mappl/scidb4gdal).
R is used as language to perform some simple SciDB operations. You need to install the scidb R package first.
